# US1.3: Role Management

**Epic:** SaaS Foundation & Identity
**Status:** Open

## Description
As a **System**, I want to handle roles (Student, Curator, Admin) so users see only what they need.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Backend implements Guards/Decorators (e.g., in NestJS) to restrict endpoints by Role
- [ ] UI conditionally renders menu items and views based on the logged-in user's role
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts to role-protected routes are blocked
